         Before moving, I studied Computer Science for two years at university, which gave me a solid foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of development. However, my journey in programming began even earlier — five years ago — through specialized courses and personal projects. I’ve gained strong skills in web design and programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java.
         Curious, meticulous, and creative, I see technology not just as a tool, but as a language to create, solve, and connect.</p>";

       contentArea.innerHTML = "<p>My main goal is to continue my university studies in France and specialize in a field I’m deeply passionate about: artificial intelligence. I firmly believe that when used wisely, AI can become a powerful driver of positive change in our society.
        Beyond academic learning, I aim to be actively involved in real-world projects and gain hands-on experience in this rapidly evolving field.
        In the long run, I want to build a strong and meaningful career, grow into positions of responsibility, and contribute to innovations that make a real impact. My ambition is not only personal success, but also to inspire and help build a smarter, fairer world.</p>";
